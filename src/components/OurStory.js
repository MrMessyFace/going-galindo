            Prior to meeting one another, both Jessie and Kelsey had several
            years’ experience with online dating apps. Both had fruitless
            attempts at finding lasting love. And then came Monday, November 23,
            2020. As Jessie tells it, they had already matched three different
            times on three different apps. Kelsey had apparently ignored his
            advances on the first two attempts. She conveniently has no
            recollection of this, but she made up for it the third time by
            taking the initiative and sending the first message.

            Neither of them knew that talking to a complete stranger would feel
            as comfortable and easy as if talking to their best friend but that
            is what they ultimately came to be. Kelsey and Jessie quickly
            connected on many levels and meeting amidst of the COVID-19 pandemic
            and living 90 miles apart, the couple learned quickly how to
            navigate challenges and make the most of their time together.

            In my teens and early 20’s, I would often think of what I was
            looking for in a partner. While some of the details changed, the
            core values I was seeking did not. I needed a man who was
            intelligent, kind, compassionate, and willing to show up and do the
            work to create a lasting relationship. I would often end
            relationships early once I figured out (or was shown) that past
            dates weren’t up to the task. Then, I met Jessie. It wasn’t all
            rainbows and butterflies, of course. We had our challenges and we
            worked together as a team to pull through these. I had a strong
            feeling about this relationship after about 6 months in. I already
            knew I loved this man, however it was only after a family tragedy
            that I realized Jessie was the one I had prayed for. When my dad
            suddenly passed away, Jessie was there for me: lending a listening
            ear, a shoulder to cry on, and sage advice to ease the pain. Jessie
            was there for me during an incredibly difficult time very early in
            our relationship, and he never seemed annoyed or uncomfortable by
            it. He was just a solid place for me. Besides this, I witnessed his
            going from bachelor to full time dad of a teenage son. Watching him
            navigate the murky waters of parenting has been an adventure, and
            one that we are now navigating together. Damian is definitely his
            child, and I have grown to love him as my own. I love what we are
            building and I cannot think of anyone I’d rather spend my life with.

            I had a couple long term relationships but they weren't fated to be.
            Coming out of my last one, I was now aware of what I really wanted
            in a partner. After an eventful 16 months of dating ups and downs, I
            found Kelsey. She was everything I wanted and more. More
            importantly, I knew she was who I needed in my life. Even though we
            had matched twice before then, we were different people at those
            times than we were when we finally met. It was like Cupid was baking
            a cake and opened the oven twice before the cake was ready and said
            "not yet." I couldn't tell you when the specific moment was that I
            knew I loved her. You could say I loved her the entire time. I just
            didn't know it until I did.
